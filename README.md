# EventCRM

SingingWithCode built his own online CRM to manage his clients and events. Salesmen were able to uniquely login, view all events, event details (booking status, dates and times, client information, location, etc.), edit event details, sort the events, track financials, view events in a calendar and list form, and more. SingingWithCode couldnâ€™t singlehandedly keep up with the needed updates and changes so discontinued the project. Since 2016, the code has become depreciated and, frankly, a security risk to the server so it can no longer be hosted. However, its legacy continues to impress. 

Here lies an extremely simple backend CRM using Oracle SQL Developer and Java was made to demonstrate this skill. Note, the database connection has been redacted.
